# Evoluationary_Programmer
This project aimed autonomously creating path planning programs for UAV and is released in the form of ROS feature packs.

Now you can simpliy run the `main.py` in script to get some result, but it can't get real drones off the ground just yet. 

And some results can be seen in the `data` folder.
## TODO
UAV control part.
